# Classes and Objects

- **Objects**:- are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. **Classes** are essentially a template to create your objects.

 **Some points on Python class**:
-  Classes are created by keyword class.
- Attributes are the variables that belong to class.
- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using dot (.) operator. Ex: Myclass.Myattribute
 
 **Declaring Objects (Also called instantiating a class)**

- When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances.

Ex:
```
  # Python program to 
  # demonstrate instantiating 
  # a class 
    
    
  class Dog:  
        
      # A simple class 
      # attribute 
      attr1 = "mamal"
      attr2 = "dog"
    
      # A sample method   
      def fun(self):  
          print("I'm a", self.attr1) 
          print("I'm a", self.attr2) 
    
  # Driver code 
  # Object instantiation 
  Rodger = Dog() 
    
  # Accessing class attributes 
  # and method through objects 
  print(Rodger.attr1) 
  Rodger.fun() 
```
 output:
 ```
 mamal
 I'm a mamal
 I'm a dog
 ```

- In the above example, an object is created which is basically a dog named Rodger. This class only has two class attributes that tell us that Rodger is a dog and a mammal.

- **The self**:- Class methods must have an extra first parameter in method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.
- If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.

- When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) – this is all the special self is about.

#####  ```__init__method```
The ```__init__``` method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java.Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
```
  # A Sample class with init method  
  class Person:  
      
      # init method or constructor   
      def __init__(self, name):  
          self.name = name  
      
      # Sample Method   
      def say_hi(self):  
          print('Hello, my name is', self.name)  
      
  p = Person('Nikhil')  
  p.say_hi()  
```
 output
```
  Hello, my name is Nikhil
```
##### Class and Instance Variables
Instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class.

**Defining instance varibale using constructor**.

```
# Python program to show that the variables with a value   
# assigned in the class declaration, are class variables and  
# variables inside methods and constructors are instance  
# variables.  
     
# Class for Dog  
  class Dog:  
      
      # Class Variable  
      animal = 'dog'             
      
      # The init method or constructor  
      def __init__(self, breed, color):  
        
          # Instance Variable      
          self.breed = breed 
          self.color = color         
      
  # Objects of Dog class  
  Rodger = Dog("Pug", "brown")  
  Buzo = Dog("Bulldog", "black")  
    
  print('Rodger details:')    
  print('Rodger is a', Rodger.animal)  
  print('Breed: ', Rodger.breed) 
  print('Color: ', Rodger.color) 
    
  print('\nBuzo details:')    
  print('Buzo is a', Buzo.animal)  
  print('Breed: ', Buzo.breed) 
  print('Color: ', Buzo.color) 
    
  # Class variables can be accessed using class  
  # name also  
  print("\nAccessing class variable using class name") 
  print(Dog.animal)       
```
Output:
```
  Rodger details:
  Rodger is a dog
  Breed:  Pug
  Color:  brown

  Buzo details:
  Buzo is a dog
  Breed:  Bulldog
  Color:  black

  Accessing class variable using class name
  dog
```
 **Defining instance variable using the normal method.**

 ```
  # Python program to show that we can create   
  # instance variables inside methods  
      
  # Class for Dog  
  class Dog:  
          
      # Class Variable  
      animal = 'dog'      
          
      # The init method or constructor  
      def __init__(self, breed):  
              
          # Instance Variable  
          self.breed = breed              
      
      # Adds an instance variable   
      def setColor(self, color):  
          self.color = color  
          
      # Retrieves instance variable      
      def getColor(self):      
          return self.color     
      
  # Driver Code  
  Rodger = Dog("pug")  
  Rodger.setColor("brown")  
  print(Rodger.getColor())   
 ```
Output:
```
  brown
```
