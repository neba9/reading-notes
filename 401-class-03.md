# File in Python

- **File** is a contiguous set of **bytes** used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a **text file** or as complicated as a **program executable**. In the end, these **byte files** are then translated into **binary 1 and 0** for easier processing by the **computer**.

- modern file systems are composed of three main parts:
1. **Header**: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)

2. **Data**: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor.

3. **End of file (EOF)**: special character that indicates the end of the file.

##### File Paths

- **The file path**:- is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

1. **Folder Path**: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows).

2. **File Name**: the actual name of the file.

3. **Extension**: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type.

##### Line Endings
 One problem often encountered when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending. The line ending has its roots from back in the Morse Code era.

##### Character Encodings 
 An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters. This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character.The two most common encodings are the **ASCII** and **UNICODE Formats**. **ASCII** can only store **128 characters**, while **Unicode** can contain up to **1,114,112 characters**.  

##### Opening and Closing a File in Python
 When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it. This is done by invoking the ```open() built-in function```. open() has a single required argument that is the path to the file. ```open()``` has a single return, the file object:
 ```file = open('dog_breeds.txt')```

- You should always make sure that an open file is properly closed.there are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is closed properly.
1. The first way to close a file is to use the ```try-finally``` block: 
```
  reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
  try:
      # Further file processing goes here
  finally:
      reader.close()
```
2. The second way to close a file is to use the with statement:
```
 with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
     # Further file processing goes here
```
- The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block.

-  you’ll also want to use the second positional argument, ```mode```. This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to represent how you want to open the file. The default and most common is ```'r'```, which represents opening the file in **read-only mode as a text file**:
```
 with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```
- The most commmonly used ```mode``` is
``` 
 Character            Meaning     
   'r'             	Open for reading (default)  
   'w'           	  Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first 
   'rb' or 'wb'     Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)
```

- There are three different categories of file objects:
1. Text files
2. Buffered binary files
3. Raw binary file
- Each of these file types are defined in the ```io module```.

1. **Text files**:_how these files are opened:
```
  open('abc.txt')

  open('abc.txt', 'r')

  open('abc.txt', 'w')
```
  With these types of files, open() will return a ```TextIOWrapper file object```:
```
  file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
  type(file)
 <class '_io.TextIOWrapper'>
```
2. **Buffered binary files**: type is used for reading and writing binary files.
```
 open('abc.txt', 'rb')

 open('abc.txt', 'wb')
```
With these types of files, ```open()``` will return either a **BufferedReader** or **BufferedWriter** file object:

```
   file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb')
   type(file)
  <class '_io.BufferedReader'>
   file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'wb')
   type(file)
  <class '_io.BufferedWriter'>
```
3. **Raw binary file**:It is therefore not typically used.
````open('abc.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)```
With these types of files, open() will return a ```FileIO``` file object:
```
  file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
  type(file)
 <class '_io.FileIO'>
```
##### Reading and Writing Opened Files
 example of how to open and read the entire file using .read():
- Read & print the entire file
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
      # Read & print the entire file
      print(reader.read())
``` 

- how to read 5 bytes of a line each time using the Python .readline() method:
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
      # Read & print the first 5 characters of the line 5 times
      print(reader.readline(5))
```
-  how to read the entire file as a list using the Python .readlines() method:
```
  f = open('dog_breeds.txt')
  f.readlines()  # Returns a list object
  ['Pug\n', 'Jack Russell Terrier\n', 'English Springer Spaniel\n', 'German Shepherd\n', 'Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n', 'Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n', 'Golden Retriever\n', 'West Highland White Terrier\n', 'Boxer\n', 'Border Terrier\n']
```
- The above example can also be done by using list() to create a list out of the file object:

```
 f = open('dog_breeds.txt')
 list(f)
```
##### Iterating Over Each Line in the File
- example of how to use the Python .readline() method to perform that iteration:
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
      # Read and print the entire file line by line
      line = reader.readline()
      while line != '':  # The EOF char is an empty string
          print(line, end='')
          line = reader.readline()
```
- Another way you could iterate over each line in the file is to use the Python .readlines() method of the file object.
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
      for line in reader.readlines():
          print(line, end='')
```
- However, the above examples can be further simplified by iterating over the file object itself:
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
      # Read and print the entire file line by line
      for line in reader:
          print(line, end='')
```

- Here’s a quick example of using ```.write() and .writelines()```:
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
      # Note: readlines doesn't trim the line endings
      dog_breeds = reader.readlines()

  with open('dog_breeds_reversed.txt', 'w') as writer:
      # Alternatively you could use
      # writer.writelines(reversed(dog_breeds))

      # Write the dog breeds to the file in reversed order
      for breed in reversed(dog_breeds):
          writer.write(breed)
```        

##### Working With Bytes
 This is done by adding the 'b' character to the mode argument. All of the same methods for the file object apply. However, each of the methods expect and return a bytes object instead:
```
  with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb') as reader:
      print(reader.readline())
  b'Pug\n'
``` 
- when you open the file and read these bytes individually, you can see that this is indeed a .png header file:

```
  with open('jack_russell.png', 'rb') as byte_reader:
      print(byte_reader.read(1))
```
### Python Exceptions:
-  In Python, an error can be a **syntax error** or an **exception**

##### Exceptions versus Syntax Errors:

- **Syntax errors**:- occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.
```
    print( 0 / 0 ))
    File "<stdin>", line 1
      print( 0 / 0 ))
                    ^
  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
The arrow indicates where the parser ran into the syntax error. In this example, there was one bracket too many. Remove it and run your code again:

```
    print( 0 / 0)
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```
This time, you ran into an exception error. This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error. The last line of the message indicated what type of exception error you ran into.

Instead of showing the message exception error, Python details what type of exception error was encountered. In this case, it was a ZeroDivisionError. Python comes with various built-in exceptions as well as the possibility to create self-defined exceptions.

- **Raising an Exception**:We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.

- **The AssertionError Exception**:We assert that a certain condition is met. If this condition turns out to be True, then that is excellent! The program can continue. If the condition turns out to be False, you can have the program throw an AssertionError exception.

- **The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions**:The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. Python executes code following the try statement as a “normal” part of the program. The code that follows the except statement is the program’s response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.
- Ex: 
```
  try:
      with open('file.log') as file:
          read_data = file.read()
  except:
      print('Could not open file.log')
```
  If file.log does not exist, this block of code will output the following:
```Could not open file.log```

**The else Clause**:In Python, using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions.

```
  try:
      linux_interaction()
  except AssertionError as error:
      print(error)
  else:
      print('Executing the else clause.')
```
  If you were to run this code on a Linux system, the output would be the following:

```
  Doing something.
  Executing the else clause.
```
**Cleaning Up After Using finally**:Imagine that you always had to implement some sort of action to clean up after executing your code. Python enables you to do so using the ```finally clause```.
```
  try:
      linux_interaction()
  except AssertionError as error:
      print(error)
  else:
      try:
          with open('file.log') as file:
              read_data = file.read()
      except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
          print(fnf_error)
  finally:
      print('Cleaning up, irrespective of any exceptions.')
```
 In the previous code, everything in the finally clause will be executed. It does not matter if you encounter an exception somewhere in the try or else clauses. Running the previous code on a Windows machine would output the following:
```
 Function can only run on Linux systems.
 Cleaning up, irrespective of any exceptions.
```
