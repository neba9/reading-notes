# HTML stractur
- uses elements to describe the stracture of pages, elements has opennig and closing tag.Tages act like containers they tell as something about the information theat lies between their opeing and closing.

- Basic structure of an HTML document has two main parts: **head**:- The head element contains title and meta data of a web document, **body**:- The body element contains the information that you want to display on a web page.

- **Attributes** tell us more about elementes, they appear on the opeing tag of the element and are made up of two patres: 
1. **name**:- indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element contents it should be written lowercase, and 
2. **value**:- the value is the information or setting for the attribute.it should be placed in double quotes.


# Extra Markup:-
-  a lightweight markup language based on Markdown implemented in PHP originally **PHP** Hypertext Preprocessor is a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development.

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

- You can add comments to your code between the ```<!-- and -->``` markers.

- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.

- The ```<div> and <span>``` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.

- ```<iframes>``` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The ```<meta>``` tag allows you to supply all kinds ofinformation about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as``` <, >, and ©```

# HTML5 Layout

- **Traditional HTML** Layouts For a long time, web page authors used ```<div>``` elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the ```<div>``` element in the structure of the page.

- **HTML 5** is the next revision of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard programming language for describing the contents and appearance of Web pages. HTML 5 was adopted by the new HTML working group of the World Wide Web.The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

- For example, the header sits inside a new ``<header>`` element, the navigation in a ```<nav>``` element, and the articles are in individual ```<article>``` elements.

- **Older browsers** that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.

# Process and Design web pages

- First you have to think about It who might be visiting your site and how to ensure the pages feature the information those visitors need.

- Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is. 

- Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

- It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs. 

- You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

- Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information ```(such as news)``` may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

# Site Maps

- The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a **site map** and it will show how those pages can be grouped.

- To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called **card sorting**.

# WireFrames

- A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
