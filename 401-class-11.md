# Numpy

**Numpy**: is a Python package and is the main library for scientific computations. It has n-dimensional array objects and tools to integrate other dominant languages such as C. You can use the NumPy array as an enormous multi-dimensional container for data. 
NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.

### What is a NumPy Array?
The NumPy array is a fantastic n-dimensional array object. It has rows and columns, and you can use it to access the elements of a Python list. There are many operations you can perform on a NumPy array.

The data was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and is available here. Here are the first few rows of the winequality-red.csv file, which we’ll be using throughout this tutorial:
```
  "fixed acidity";"volatile acidity";"citric acid";"residual sugar";"chlorides";"free sulfur dioxide";"total sulfur dioxide";"density";"pH";"sulphates";"alcohol";"quality"
  7.4;0.7;0;1.9;0.076;11;34;0.9978;3.51;0.56;9.4;5
  7.8;0.88;0;2.6;0.098;25;67;0.9968;3.2;0.68;9.8;5
```

The data is in what I’m going to call ssv (semicolon separated values) format — each record is separated by a semicolon (;), and rows are separated by a new line.

**Lists Of Lists for CSV Data**:Before using NumPy, we’ll first try to work with the data using Python and the csv package. We can read in the file using the csv.reader object, which will allow us to read in and split up all the content from the ssv file.

In the below code, we:

Import the csv library.
Open the winequality-red.csv file.
  With the file open, create a new csv.reader object.
      Pass in the keyword argument delimiter=";" to make sure that the records are split up on the semicolon character instead of the default comma character.
  Call the list type to get all the rows from the file.
  Assign the result to wines.

```
  import csv
  with open('winequality-red.csv', 'r') as f:
      wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'))
```
Once we’ve read in the data, we can print out the first 3 rows:
```print(wines[:3])```

```[['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'quality'], ['7.4', '0.7', '0', '1.9', '0.076', '11', '34', '0.9978', '3.51', '0.56', '9.4', '5'], ['7.8', '0.88', '0', '2.6', '0.098', '25', '67', '0.9968', '3.2', '0.68', '9.8', '5']]```

The data has been read into a list of lists. Each inner list is a row from the ssv file. As you may have noticed, each item in the entire list of lists is represented as a string, which will make it harder to do computations.

We’ll format the data into a table to make it easier to view:

The below code will:

- Extract the last element from each row after the header row.
- Convert each extracted element to a float.
- Assign all the extracted elements to the list qualities.
- Divide the sum of all the elements in qualities by the total number of - -  elements in qualities to the get the mean.

```
  qualities =
  [float(item[-1]) for item in wines[1:]]
  sum(qualities) / len(qualities)
```
**Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays:** 2-dimensional array is also known as a **matrix**. it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix. 

In a NumPy array, the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis. So the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis.

**Creating A NumPy Array:**We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns. Because we want all of the elements in the array to be float elements for easy computation, we’ll leave off the header row, which contains strings. One of the limitations of NumPy is that all the elements in an array have to be of the same type, so if we include the header row, all the elements in the array will be read in as strings. Because we want to be able to do computations like find the average quality of the wines, we need the elements to all be floats.

- **In the below code, we:**
- Import the numpy package.
- Pass the list of lists wines into the array function, which converts it into a NumPy array.
    - Exclude the header row with list slicing.
    - Specify the keyword argument dtype to make sure each element is converted to a float. We’ll dive more into what the dtype is later on.
```
  import csv
  with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
      wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
  import numpy as np
  wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```
If we display wines, we’ll now get a NumPy array: ```wines```

```
  array([[ 7.4 , 0.7 , 0. , ..., 0.56 , 9.4 , 5. ],
  [ 7.8 , 0.88 , 0. , ..., 0.68 , 9.8 , 5. ],
  [ 7.8 , 0.76 , 0.04 , ..., 0.65 , 9.8 , 5. ],
  ...,
  [ 6.3 , 0.51 , 0.13 , ..., 0.75 , 11. , 6. ],
  [ 5.9 , 0.645, 0.12 , ..., 0.71 , 10.2 , 5. ],
  [ 6. , 0.31 , 0.47 , ..., 0.66 , 11. , 6. ]])
```
We can check the number of rows and columns in our data using the shape property of NumPy arrays:
```wines.shape```
```(1599, 12)```

**Alternative NumPy Array Creation Methods:**
There are a variety of methods that you can use to create NumPy arrays. To start with, you can create an array where every element is zero. The below code will create an array with 3 rows and 4 columns, where every element is 0, using numpy.zeros:

```import numpy as np```
```empty_array = np.zeros((3,4)) empty_array```

It’s useful to create an array with all zero elements in cases when you need an array of fixed size, but don’t have any values for it yet.

You can also create an array where each element is a random number using ```numpy.random.rand```. Here’s an example:

```np.random.rand(3,4)```

```
  array([[ 0.2247223 , 0.92240549, 0.14541893, 0.61731257],
  [ 0.00154957, 0.82342197, 0.74044906, 0.11466845],
  [ 0.6152478 , 0.14433138, 0.13009583, 0.22981301]])
```
Creating arrays full of random numbers can be useful when you want to quickly test your code with sample arrays.

**Using NumPy To Read In Files:**It’s possible to use NumPy to directly read csv or other files into arrays. We can do this using the ```numpy.genfromtxt``` function. We can use it to read in our initial data on red wines.

- In the below code, we:

- Use the genfromtxt function to read in the winequality-red.csv file.
- Specify the keyword argument delimiter=";" so that the fields are parsed properly.
- Specify the keyword argument skip_header=1 so that the header row is skipped.

```wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)```
```wines``` will end up looking the same as if we read it into a list then converted it to an array of floats. NumPy will automatically pick a data type for the elements in an array based on their format.
