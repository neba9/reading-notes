# Django Forms

**Django**:- Forms take a lot of the work out of all these steps, by providing a framework that lets you define forms and their fields programmatically, and then use these objects to both generate the form HTML code and handle much of the validation and user interaction.

**HTML Forms**:- The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside ```<form>...</form>``` tags, containing at least one input element of ```type="submit"```.

```
  <form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
      <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
      <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
      <input type="submit" value="OK">
  </form>
```
- The ```field's type``` attribute defines what sort of widget will be displayed. 

- The ```name and id``` of the field are used to identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML, while ```value``` defines the initial value for the field when it is first displayed.

- The matching team ```label``` is specified using the label tag (see "Enter name" above), with a ```for``` field containing the ```id``` value of the associated input.


- The ```submit`` input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server. 

- ```action```: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.

- ```method```: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.

   - ```The POST method``` **should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database** because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.

   - ```The GET method``` **should only be used for forms that don't change user data** (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

#### Declaring a Form

The declaration syntax for a *Form* is very similar to that for declaring a *Model*, and shares the same field types (and some similar parameters). This makes sense because in both cases we need to ensure that each field handles the right types of data, is constrained to valid data, and has a description for display/documentation.

**Form data** is stored in an application's ```forms.py file```, inside the application directory. Create and open the file ```locallibrary/catalog/forms.py.``` To create a ```Form```, we import the ```forms library```, derive from the ```Form class```, and declare the form's fields.

```
  from django import forms

  class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
      renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```
**Form fields**:- There are many other types of form fields.

**Validation**:- There are two important things to note. The first is that we get our data.

- using ```self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']``` and that we return this data whether or not we change it at the end of the function. This step gets us the data "cleaned" and sanitized of potentially unsafe input using the default validators, and converted into the correct standard type for the data (in this case a Python ```datetime.datetime object```).

- The second point is that if a value falls outside our range we raise a ```ValidationError```, specifying the error text that we want to display in the form if an invalid value is entered. The example above also wraps this text in one of Django's translation functions ```ugettext_lazy()``` (imported as _()), which is good practice if you want to translate your site later.

**URL configuration**:- Before we create our view, let's add a URL configuration for the renew-books page.
```
  urlpatterns += [
      path('book/<uuid:pk>/renew/', views.renew_book_librarian, name='renew-book-librarian'),
  ]
```
- The URL configuration will redirect URLs with the format

**View**:-  the view has to render the default form when it is first called and then either re-render it with error messages if the data is invalid, or process the data and redirect to a new page if the data is valid.

forms that use a ```POST``` request to submit information to the server, the most common pattern is for the view to test against the ```POST``` request type ```(if request.method == 'POST':)``` to identify form validation requests and ```GET``` (using an ```else``` condition) to identify the initial form creation request. If you want to submit your data using a ```GET``` request, then a typical approach for identifying whether this is the first or subsequent view invocation is to read the form data (e.g. to read a hidden value in the form).

- In the view, we first use the ```pk``` argument in ```get_object_or_404()``` to get the current ```BookInstance``` (if this does not exist, the view will immediately exit and the page will display a "not found" error). If this is not a ```POST request``` (handled by the ```else``` clause) then we create the default form passing in an initial value for the ```renewal_date``` field (as shown in bold below, this is 3 weeks from the current date). 

```
      book_instance = get_object_or_404(BookInstance, pk=pk)

      # If this is a GET (or any other method) create the default form
      else:
          proposed_renewal_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=3)
          form = RenewBookForm(initial={'renewal_date': proposed_renewal_date})

      context = {
          'form': form,
          'book_instance': book_instance,
      }

      return render(request, 'catalog/book_renew_librarian.html', context)
```

- After creating the form, we call ```render()``` to create the HTML page, specifying the template and a context that contains our form.
