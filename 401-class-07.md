# globals()

- In Python, **globals()** is a built-in function that returns a reference to the current global scope or namespace dictionary. This dictionary always stores the names of the current module. This means that if you call globals() in a given module, then you’ll get a dictionary containing all the names that you’ve defined in that module, right before the call to globals().
**globals()** function in Python returns the **dictionary of current global symbol table**.

- **Symbol table**: Symbol table is a data structure which contains all necessary information about the program. These include variable names, methods, classes, etc.
**Global symbol table** stores all information related to the global scope of the program, and is accessed in Python using globals() method.
The functions, variables which are not associated with any class or function are stored in global scope.

```
  Syntax: globals()
```
Parameters: No parameters required.

Ex1: 
```
  # Python3 program to demonstrate global() function 
    
  # global variable 
  a = 5
    
  def func(): 
      c = 10
      d = c + a 
        
      # Calling globals() 
      globals()['a'] = d 
      print (d) 
        
  # Driver Code     
  func() 
```
outpu:```15```

Ex1:
```
  # Python3 program to demonstrate global() function 
    
  # global variable 
  name = 'gautam'
    
  print('Before modification:', name) 
    
  # Calling global() 
  globals()['name'] = 'gautam karakoti'
  print('After modification:', name) 
```
output: 
```
  Before modification: gautam
  After modification: gautam karakoti
```

Ex: 
```
  >>> globals()
  {'__name__': '__main__',..., '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>}
  >>> my_var = 100
  >>> globals()
  {'__name__': '__main__',..., 'my_var': 100}
```
- The first call to globals() returns a dictionary containing the names in your __main__ module or program.Note that when you assign a new name at the top level of the module, like in my_var = 100, the name is added to the dictionary returned by globals().

An interesting example of how you can use globals() in your code would be to dynamically dispatch functions that live in the global scope. Suppose you want to dynamically dispatch platform-dependent functions. To do this, you can use globals() as follows:

```
  # Filename: dispatch.py

  from sys import platform

  def linux_print():
      print('Printing from Linux...')

  def win32_print():
      print('Printing from Windows...')

  def darwin_print():
      print('Printing from macOS...')

  printer = globals()[platform + '_print']

  printer()
```
Another example of how to use globals() would be to inspect the list of special names in the global scope. Take a look at the following list comprehension:

```
  >>> [name for name in globals() if name.startswith('__')]
  ['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__',..., '__annotations__', '__builtins__']
```
This list comprehension will return a list with all the special names that are defined in your current global Python scope. Note that you can use the globals() dictionary just like you would use any regular dictionary. For example, you can iterate through it through it using these traditional methods:
   .keys()
   .values()
   .items()

You can also perform regular subscription operations over globals() by using square brackets like in globals()['name']. For example, you can modify the content of globals() even though this isn’t recommended. Take a look at this example:
```
  >>> globals()['__doc__'] = """Docstring for __main__."""
  >>> __doc__
  'Docstring for __main__.'
```
Here, you change the key __doc__ to include a docstring for __main__ so that from now on, the main module’s docstring will have the value 'Docstring for __main__.'.

# locals()
Another function related to Python scope and namespaces is **locals()**. This function **updates and returns** a **dictionary** that holds a **copy** of the **current state of the local Python scope or namespace**. When you call locals() in a function block, you get all the names assigned in the local or function scope up to the point where you call locals().

Local symbol table stores all information related to the local scope of the program, and is accessed in Python using locals() method.

The local scope could be within a function, within a class, etc.

- The syntax of locals() method is:
```
  locals()
```
**locals()** method doesn't take any parameters.
**locals()** method updates and returns the dictionary associated with the current local symbol table.

Ex: 
```
  >>> def func(arg):
  ...     var = 100
  ...     print(locals())
  ...     another = 200
  ...
  >>> func(300)
  {'var': 100, 'arg': 300}
```
Whenever you call locals() inside func(), the resulting dictionary contains the name var mapped to the value 100 and arg mapped to 300. Since locals() only grabs the names assigned before you call it, another is not in the dictionary.

If you call locals() in the global Python scope, then you’ll get the same dictionary that you would get if you were to call globals():

```
  >>> locals()
  {'__name__': '__main__',..., '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>}
  >>> locals() is globals()
  True
```
When you call locals() in the global Python scope, you get a dictionary that’s identical to the dictionary returned by the call to globals().

Note that you shouldn’t modify the content of locals() because changes may have no effect on the values of local and free names. Check out the following example:
```
  >>> def func():
  ...     var = 100
  ...     locals()['var'] = 200
  ...     print(var)
  ...
  >>> func()
  100
```
When you try to modify the content of var using locals(), the change doesn’t reflect in the value of var. So, you can say that locals() is only useful for read operations since updates to the locals dictionary are ignored by Python.
