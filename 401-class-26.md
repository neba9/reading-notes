# Django

**Django**:-  is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. 

**Install Django**:- Before you can use Django, you’ll need to install it. You’ve got three options to install Django:
1. *Install an official release*. This is the best approach for most users.
```$ python -m pip install Django```

2. *Install a version of Django provided by your operating system distribution*.

3. *Install the latest development version.*

#### Intro to Django

**Object-relational mapper**:- Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.
```
  class Band(models.Model):
      """A model of a rock band."""
      name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
      can_rock = models.BooleanField(default=True)


  class Member(models.Model):
      """A model of a rock band member."""
      name = models.CharField("Member's name", max_length=200)
      instrument = models.CharField(choices=(
              ('g', "Guitar"),
              ('b', "Bass"),
              ('d', "Drums"),
          ),
          max_length=1
      )
      band = models.ForeignKey("Band")
```

**URLs and views**:- A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web application. Django encourages beautiful URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

```
  from django.urls import path

  from . import views

  urlpatterns = [
      path('bands/', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
      path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
      path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
  ]
```
**Templates**:- Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.
```
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Band Listing</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>All Bands</h1>
      <ul>
      {% for band in bands %}
        <li>
          <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
          {% if band.can_rock %}<p>This band can rock!</p>{% endif %}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
```

**Forms**:- Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.
```
  from django import forms

  class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
      subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
      message = forms.CharField()
      sender = forms.EmailField()
      cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
```

**Authentication**:- Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.
```
  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
  from django.shortcuts import render

  @login_required
  def my_protected_view(request):
      """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
      return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})
```

**Admin**:- One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many hooks for customization.
```
  from django.contrib import admin
  from bands.models import Band, Member

  class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
      list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
      list_filter = ('band',)

  admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
  admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options
```

**Internationalization**:- Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize Web applications for particular users according to their preferences.
```
  from django.shortcuts import render
  from django.utils.translation import gettext

  def homepage(request):
      """
      Shows the homepage with a welcome message that is translated in the
      user's language.
      """
      message = gettext('Welcome to our site!')
      return render(request, 'homepage.html', {'message': message})
```
```
  {% load i18n %}
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>{% trans 'Homepage - Hall of Fame' %}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      {# Translated in the view: #}
      <h1>{{ message }}</h1>
      <p>
        {% blocktrans count member_count=bands.count %}
        Here is the only band in the hall of fame:
        {% plural %}
        Here are all the {{ member_count }} bands in the hall of fame:
        {% endblocktrans %}
      </p>
      <ul>
      {% for band in bands %}
        <li>
          <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
          {% if band.can_rock %}<p>{% trans 'This band can rock!' %}</p>{% endif %}
        </li>
      {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
```

**Security**:- Django provides multiple protections against:

      - Clickjacking

      - Cross-site scripting

      - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

      - SQL injection

      - Remote code execution
