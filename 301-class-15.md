# Why diversity matters to your tech company

- Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders
- **Diverse teams are smarter and more creative** :Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation.

- **According to Scott E. Page,professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan:**"Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

- **Diverse companies perform better**:Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

- **Companies are losing out on great talent**:Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.

- **Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base**:
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.

- **It’s the right thing to do**: While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, we’ve spoken with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.
