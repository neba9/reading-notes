# SQL

- **SQL(Structured Query Language)**:- is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

- There are many popular SQL databases including.

- SQLite

- MySQL

- Postgres

- Oracle and 

- Microsoft SQL Service

-  All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

- ### Relational databases

- **A relational database**:- represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

**SELECT queries**

- To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT** statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.

- Ex; Seleect query a sspecific columns 
```SELECT column. anther_column,```
```FROM mytable;```

- The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table, but only with the columns that we requested.

- Ex: Select query from all columns.
```SELECT *```
```FROM mytable;```

- This query, in particular, is really useful because it's a simple way to inspect a table by dumping all the data at once.

- **Queries with constraints**:

- In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a **WHERE** clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

-  Ex: Select query with constrants

```SELECT column, another_column,```
```FROM mytable```
```WHERE condition```
    ```AND/OR another_conditon```
    ```AND/OR...;```

- More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous **AND** or **OR** logical keywords.

- **some useful operators that you can use for numerical data**

- Operator              Conditions

- =, !=, < <=, >, >=   Standard numerical operators

- BETWEEN … AND …      Number is within range of two values (inclusive)

- NOT BETWEEN … AND …   Number is not within range of two values (inclusive)

- IN (…)                 Number exists in a list

- NOT IN (…)             Number does not exist in a list.

- When writing **WHERE** clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching.

- Ex: ```operator != or <>```
```case sensitive exact string inquality comparism```
```col_name != "abc"```

- **Filtering and sorting Query results**:-

-  **SQL** provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the **DISTINCT** keyword.

- Ex: Select query with unique results

```SELECT DISTINCT colunm, another_column,...```
```FROM mytable```
```WHERE condition(s);```

- Since the **DISTINCT** keyword will blindly remove duplicate rows.

- **Ordering results**:-SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in **ascending** or **descending** order using the **ORDER BY** clause.

- Ex: Select query with ordered results

```SELECT colunm. another_colunm,```
```FROM mytable```
```WHERE condition(s)```
```OREDR BY colunm ASC/desc```

- When an **ORDER BY** clause is specified, each row is sorted alpha-numerically based on the specified column's value. In some databases, you can also specify a collation to better sort data containing international text.

- **Limiting results to a subset**:- **ORDER BY** clause are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about.

- The **LIMIT** will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional

- **OFFSET** will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.

- Ex: Select query with limited rows

```SELECT colunm, another_colunm,```
```FROM mytable```
```WHERE condition(s)```
```OREEDER BY column ASC/DESC```
```LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_fooset;```

- **Inserting rows**

- **table** in a database as a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, with the columns being the properties and the rows being instances of the entity in the table

- **What is a Schema?**: In SQL, the database **schema** is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.

- Ex: Insert statement with values for all columns

```INSERT INTO mytabe```
```VALUES (value_or_expr, anther_value_orexpr,...),```
```VALUES (value_or_expr_2, anther_value_orexpr_2,...),```

- if you have incomplete data and the table contains columns that support default values, you can insert rows with only the columns of data you have by specifying them explicitly.

- Ex: Insert statement with specific columns

```INSRT INTO mytable```
```(column, another_column,..)```
```VALUES (value_or_expr, anther_value_orexpr,...),```
```VALUES (value_or_expr_2, anther_value_orexpr_2,...);```

- Example Insert statement with expressions

```INSERT INTO boxoffice```
```(movie_id, rating, sales_in_millions)```
```VALUES (1, 9.9, 283742034 / 1000000);```

- **Updating rows**: common task is to update **existing data**, which can be done using an **UPDATE** statement.Similar to the INSERT statement.you have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update.updating data  has to match the dat type of the column in the table schema.

- Ex: Update statement with values

```UPDATE mytable```
```SET column = value_or_expr,```
    ```other_column = another_value_or_expr'```
```WHER condition;```      

- **Deleting rows**:
- Ex: Delete statement with condition

```DELETE FROM mytable```
```WHERE conditon;```

- Like the **UPDATE** statement from last lesson, it's recommended that you run the constraint in a **SELECT** query first to ensure that you are removing the right rows.

- **Creating tables**:-When you have new entities and relationships to store in your database, you can create a new database table using the CREATE TABLE statement.

- Ex: Create table statement w/ optional table constraint and default value.

```CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (```
  ```column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,```
    ```another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,```
    …
```);```

- example **schema** for the Movies table that we've been using in the lessons up to now.
- Movies table schema

```CEARTE TABLE ,ovies (```
  ```id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,```
  ```title TEXT,```
  ```director TEXT,```
  ```year INTEGER,```
 ``` length_minutes INTEGER```
```);```

- **Altering tables**:-SQL provides a way for you to update your corresponding tables and database schemas by using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

- Ex: Altering table to add new column(s)

```ALTER TABLE mytable```
```ADD column DataType optionalTableCostraint```
       ```DEFAULT default_value;```

- Ex: Altering table to remove column(s)

```ALTER TABLE mytable```
```DROP column_to_be_deleted;```

- Ex: Altering table name

```ALTER TABLE mytable```
```REANAME TO new_table_name;```

- **Dropping tables**:you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, which differs from the DELETE statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.which differs from the **DELETE** statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.

- Ex: Drop table statement

```DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;```

-  Like the **CREATE TABLE** statement, the database may throw an error if the specified table does not exist, and to suppress that error, you can use the **IF EXISTS** clause.

- if you have another table that is dependent on columns in table you are removing.(for example, with a **FOREIGN KEY** dependency).
