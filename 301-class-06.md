# NODE.JS

- **Node.js**:- is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

- **Node.js** is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

- **Node** comes bundled with a package manager called **npm**.In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.

-  the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server. 

- Ex: **interacting with a database**:block the execution of your code until the operation has completed. That is, the server has to wait for the database lookup to complete before it can move on to processing the result.

- **node.js** none-blocking 

- **Here is how Node.js handles a file request:**

1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.

2. Ready to handle the next request.

3. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.

- **Node.js** eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

- **Node.js**: runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.


- Ex: **“Hello, World!” example HTTP server**:
- ```const http = require('http');

```http.createServer((request, response) => {```
  ```response.writeHead(200);```
 ```response.end('Hello, World!');```
```}).listen(3000);```

```console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');```

1. The anonymous function is called with two arguments (request and response).

2.  These contain the request from the user and the response, which we use to send back a 200 HTTP status code, along with our “Hello World!” message.

3. Finally, we tell the server to listen for incoming requests on port 3000, and output a message to the terminal to let us know it’s running.


- **What Can Node.js Do?**:

1. Node.js can generate dynamic page content

2. Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server

3. Node.js can collect form data

4. Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

- **What is a Node.js File?**:

1. Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events

2. A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server

3. Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect

4. Node.js files have extension ".js"

- **What Are the Advantages of Node.js?**:

- speed and scalability

- when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.

- This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.

- **Other Uses of Node**:

-  it can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC.

- It can also be used to write your own command line tool, such as this Yeoman-Style generator to scaffold out new projects.

- Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.
