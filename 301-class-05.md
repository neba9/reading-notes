# HEROKU

- **Heroku**:- is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps.

- **Heroku**:- is known for running apps in dynos â€“ which are really just virtual computers that can be powered up or down based on how big your application is. Think of dynos as malleable building blocks for running your app.

- If you want to process more data or run more complex tasks, you are going to need to add more blocks **(what is called scaling horizontally)** or increase the size of the blocks **(what is called scaling vertically)**
