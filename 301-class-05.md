# HEROKU

- **Heroku**:- is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps.

- **Heroku**:- is known for running apps in dynos – which are really just virtual computers that can be powered up or down based on how big your application is. Think of dynos as malleable building blocks for running your app.

- If you want to process more data or run more complex tasks, you are going to need to add more blocks **(what is called scaling horizontally)** or increase the size of the blocks **(what is called scaling vertically)**

1. In this step you’ll install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI).
- ```sudo snap install heroku --classic```

2. to prepare a sample application that’s ready to be deployed to Heroku - ```git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git```
- ```cd node-js-getting-started```

3. to deploy the app to Heroku.
- ```heroku create``` to creat an app.
- ```git push heroku main``` deploy your code.
- ```heroku ps:scale web=1``` to Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
- ```heroku open``` visit the app at the URL generated by its app name.As a handy shortcut.
