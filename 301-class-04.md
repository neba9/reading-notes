# Regular Expression

- **Regular Expression (RegExp)**:- is an object that describes a pattern of characters.

- **Regular expressions** are used to perform pattern-matching and "search-and-replace" functions on text.When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

-  **regular expression** can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.


- **In JavaScript**: regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: **search()** and **replace()**.

1. The **search()** method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

- Ex:- **Using String search() With a String**
- ```var str = "Visit w3schools!";```
```var n = str.search("w3schools");```

- Ex **Using String search() With a Regular Expression**
- ```var str = "Visit w3schools";```
```var n = str.search(/w3schools/i);```

- resalt in n:  6.

- Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:

2. The **replace()** method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

- Ex:- **Using String replace() With a String**
- ```var str = "Visit Microsoft!";```
```var res = str.replace("Microsoft", "w3schools");```

- The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:

- Ex:- **Use String replace() With a Regular Expression**
- ```var str = "Visit Microsoft!";```
```var res = str.replace(/microsoft/i, "w3schools");```

- Use a case insensitive regular expression to replace 
Microsoft with w3schools in a string:

- **Regular Expression Modifiers**

- ```i``` : do 	Perform case-insensitive matching.

- ```g``` : do  Perform a global match (find all matches 
rather than stopping after the first match).

- ```m``` : do  Perform multiline matching.

- **Regular Expression Patterns**

- ```[abc]``` : Find any of the characters between the brackets.

- ```[0-9]``` : Find any of the digits between the brackets.

- ```(x|y)``` : 	Find any of the alternatives separated with |.

- **Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:**

- ```\d``` : Find a digit.

- ```\s``` : Find a whitespace character.

- ```\b``` : Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b.

- ```uxxxx``` :Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx.

- **Quantifiers define quantities:**

- ```n+``` : 	Matches any string that contains at least one n.

- ```n*``` : 	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n.

- ```n?``` : 	Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n.
