# Panda

**Pandas**: is an open-source library that is built on top of NumPy library. It is a Python package that offers various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. It is mainly popular for importing and analyzing data much easier. Pandas is fast and it has high-performance & productivity for users.

**Pandas** is built on the numpy library and written in languages like Python, Cython, and C. In pandas, we can import data from various file formats like JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel, etc.

**importing Pandas** in Python with the **pd** alias. Then, you use **.read_csv()** to read in your dataset and store it as a DataFrame object in the variable **nba**.

This is a short introduction to pandas, geared mainly for new users. 

Customarily, we import as follows:
```
  In [1]: import numpy as np

  In [2]: import pandas as pd
```
Example Let's start with Pandas

```
  #load library - pd is just an alias. I used pd because it's short and literally abbreviates pandas.
  #You can use any name as an alias. 
  import pandas as pd
```

```
  #create a data frame - dictionary is used here where keys get converted to column names and values to row values.
  data = pd.DataFrame({'Country': ['Russia','Colombia','Chile','Equador','Nigeria'],
                      'Rank':[121,40,100,130,11]})
  data
```
```
     Country   Rank
0    Russia    121
1    Colombia  40
2    Chile     100
3    Equador   130
4    Nigeria   11
```
```
  #We can do a quick analysis of any data set using:
  data.describe()
```
```
           Rank
  count  5.000000
  mean   80.400000
  std    52.300096
  min    11.000000
  25%    40.000000
  50%    100.000000
  75%    121.000000
  max    130.000000
```
Remember, describe() method computes summary statistics of integer / double variables. To get the complete information about the data set, we can use info() function.

```
  #Among other things, it shows the data set has 5 rows and 2 columns with their respective names.
  data.info()
  <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
  RangeIndex: 5 entries, 0 to 4
  Data columns (total 2 columns):
  Country    5 non-null object
  Rank       5 non-null int64
  dtypes: int64(1), object(1)
  memory usage: 152.0+ bytes


  #Let's create another data frame.
  data = pd.DataFrame({'group':['a', 'a', 'a', 'b','b', 'b', 'c', 'c','c'],'ounces':[4, 3, 12, 6, 7.5, 8, 3, 5, 6]})
  data
```
```
      group	ounces
  0     a	    4.0
  1	    a	    3.0
  2	    a	    12.0
  3	    b	    6.0
  4	    b	    7.5
  5    	b	    8.0
  6   	c	    3.0
  7	    c	    5.0
  8	    c	    6.0
```
```
  #Let's sort the data frame by ounces - inplace = True will make changes to the data
  data.sort_values(by=['ounces'],ascending=True,inplace=False)
```
```
       group	ounces
  1	     a	   3.0
  6	     c	   3.0
  0	     a	   4.0
  7	     c	   5.0
  3	     b	   6.0
  8	     c	   6.0
  4	     b	   7.5
  5	     b	   8.0
  2	     a	   12.0
```
We can sort the data by not just one column but multiple columns as well.
```
  data.sort_values(by=['group','ounces'],ascending=[True,False],inplace=False)
```
```
     group	ounces
  2	  a	    12.0
  0	  a	    4.0
  1	  a	    3.0
  5	  b	    8.0
  4	  b	    7.5
  3	  b	    6.0
  8	  c	    6.0
  7	  c	    5.0
  6	  c	    3.0
```
Often, we get data sets with duplicate rows, which is nothing but noise. Therefore, before training the model, we need to make sure we get rid of such inconsistencies in the data set. Let's see how we can remove duplicate rows.

```
  #create another data with duplicated rows
  data = pd.DataFrame({'k1':['one']*3 + ['two']*4, 'k2':[3,2,1,3,3,4,4]})
  data
```
```
      k1	k2
  0	  one	 3
  1	  one	 2
  2	  one	 1
  3	  two	 3
  4	  two	 3
  5	  two	 4
  6	  two	 4
```
```
  #remove duplicates - ta da! 
  data.drop_duplicates()
```
Here, we removed duplicates based on matching row values across all columns. Alternatively, we can also remove duplicates based on a particular column. Let's remove duplicate values from the k1 column.

```data.drop_duplicates(subset='k1')```
Now, we will learn to categorize rows based on a predefined criteria. It happens a lot while data processing where you need to categorize a variable. For example, say we have got a column with country names and we want to create a new variable 'continent' based on these country names. In such situations, we will require the steps below:


Example:

# Importing pandas library   
```import pandas as pd``` 

# Creating and initializing a nested list 
```
  age = [['Aman', 95.5, "Male"], ['Sunny', 65.7, "Female"], 
        ['Monty', 85.1, "Male"], ['toni', 75.4, "Male"]] 
````

# Creating a pandas dataframe 
```df = pd.DataFrame(age, columns=['Name', 'Marks', 'Gender'])``` 

# Printing dataframe 
```df```

output
```
      Name    Marks    Gender
  0  Aman    95.5      Male
  1  Sunny   65.7      Female
  2  Monty   85.1      Male
  3  toni    75.4      Male
```

**Pandas Series.to_numpy()** function is used to return a NumPy ndarray representing the values in given Series or Index.

This function will explain how we can convert the pandas Series to numpy Array. Although itâ€™s very simple, but the concept behind this technique is very unique. Because we know the Series having index in the output. Whereas in numpy arrays we only have elements in the numpy arrays.

Changing the Series into numpy array by using a method Series.to_numpy(). Always remember that when dealing with lot of data you should clean the data first to get the high accuracy. Although in this code we use the first five values of Weight column by using .head() method.
```
  # importing pandas 
  import pandas as pd  

  # reading the csv   
  data = pd.read_csv("nba.csv")  

  data.dropna(inplace = True)

  # creating series form weight column 
  gfg = pd.Series(data['Weight'].head())

  # using to_numpy() function 
  print(type(gfg.to_numpy())) 
```

Output :
```[180. 235. 185. 235. 238.]```
