# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

**Encryption**:- is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information. Encryption does not itself prevent interference but denies the intelligible content to a would-be interceptor.

**Encrypting a message**
Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:

```SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE```

Here's what that might look like encrypted:

```YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK```

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.

To make the encrypted message above, I shifted the alphabet by 6 and used this substitution table:

```
  A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
  G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F

```

S shifts 6 letters over to Y, E shifts 6 letters over to K, etc. Here's the first word and its shifts:

```
  S	E	C	R	E	T
  Y	K	I	X	K	Z

```

**Decrypting a message**

According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

Imagine Caesar sends this message to a comrade:
EHZDUH EUXWXV
The comrade uses this substitution table, where the alphabet is shifted by 3:

```
  A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z
  D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C

```
They can then decode the message with certainty. The first letter "E" was shifted by 3 from "B", the second letter "H" was shifted by 3 from "E", etc. The result is this ominous message:

**Cracking the cipher**
Imagine that a very literate and savvy enemy intercepts one of Caesar's messages.

RZ VMZ WMDIBDIB VGG AJMXZN OJ EJDI RDOC XGZJKVOMV OJ YZAZVO OCZ ZIZHT LPZZI VO OCZ IDGZ YZGOV

That enemy does not know that Caesar always uses a shift of 3, so he must attempt to "crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.

There are three main techniques he could use: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.

**Frequency analysis**

Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

Try it out yourself! Paste the message in the text area below and analyze the frequency graph to identify a possible "E":
