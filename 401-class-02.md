# Unit tests and TDD

- **Unit tests**:- are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

- **Test driven development (TDD)**:- is an software development approach in which a test is written before writing the code. Once the new code passes the test, it is refactored to an acceptable standard.

- Ex: They hired you to identify the gender of a person based on his/her name. Luckily, there is an amazing API called Genderize.io that identifies the possible genders. And you quickly developed your API connection:
```
 requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name=ana')
```

- However the client demands you to write unit tests and you are curious about TDD

- **Baby Steps**:- The API is pretty straightforward and your work was almost done. But with TDD we need to think about tests first.

- Coming back to the code and thinking with baby steps, what is the smaller test that we can do against a function (method/class) that will return the gender?

- **Just recaping**: we have a name as input and we need to return a gender as output. So, the smaller test is: given a name, return a gender.
```
  Input: Ana [name]
 Output: female [gender]
```
-Hun… Are we going to write a test just to check if given Anashould return female?
-Exactly!
-But we don’t have any code!
-We don’t!

- **Important aspects about the unit test**
 Let’s write our first test!
```
 def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Ana’)
    assert expected_gender == ‘female’
``` 
- There are some details to pay attention. The first one is the test name. The tests can be considered as your alive documentation. We need to be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing. In this case we explicitly said ```should return female when the name is from a female.```

- The test file name should follow the same name of module name. For instance, if our module is ```gender.py```, our test name should be ```test_gender.py```. It’s ideal to separate the tests folder from production code (the implementation) and to have something like this:

```
 mymodule/
 — module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — another_module.py
 tests/
 — test_module.py
 — another_folder/
 — — test_another_module.py
```
- Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the **AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert**.

- **Arrange**: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);

- **Act**: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);

- **Assert**: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

 and then Now you can execute the tests.suggested the lib ```pytest``` to do it.

##### The Cycle 
 **The cycle is made by three steps**:

- Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)

- Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)

- Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)
  **Using baby steps you can go through this cycle every time you add or modify a new feature in your code.**

##### Time for you to think

We just need to write the method that returns the right answer: FEMALE!

```
 def run(self, name):
    return 'female'
```
##### TDD is not about the money/tests
```More than any checking, we need to think about our software design first.```

When we are writing tests we are forced to think about the design first and how we can break it into small pieces.

Let’s write one more test. Besides female names, we need to identify male names as well.
```
 def test_should_return_male_when_the_name_is_from_male_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Pedro’)
    assert expected_gender == ‘male’
```
- But when we run it will fail because we just return female, right? Let’s fix it using our real code.
```
  import requests

 def run(self, name):
     result = requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name{}'
 .format(name))
     return result['gender']
```
- The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the **software design first**.
- Your code will be more **reliable**: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace.
- Beginning may be hard — and that’s fine. You just need to **practice**!

## Recursion

- **Recursion**:- The process in which a function calls itself **directly** or **indirectly** is called **recursion** and the corresponding function is called as **recursive** function.Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

 **This means that a recursive function typically possesses the following qualities**:

 - A Recursive function will continue to call itself and repeat it’s self-referential act until a condition is met in order to return a result.

 - A typical recursive function shares a common structure that consists of two parts: (i) **The recursive case**: The part which breaks down the problem into simpler ones.. and (ii) **The base case**: The terminating condition which stops the function once it is met.

 - Simple Example: we need to print hello repeatdly.
 
 ```
  def hello();
    print('hello')
    hello()
  hello()  
 ```
 Sure enough, if you run the snippet above, you get “hello” printed hundreds of times until the program eventually terminates with a ‘Recursion Error’.
- **Recursion Error Explained**

  A recursion error happens when the program has performed a recursive function a number of times greater than than the recursion limit. In order words, a recursion error is thrown when your (recursive) function has called itself up to a pre-defined limit called the recursion limit. 

 **By default, the recursion limit in a python program is 1000 times. i.e, a recursive function can run for a 1000 times before it throws a recursion error.**importance of the recursion limit is to help prevent your program from running for so long that it crashes your application or worse still, damages your CPU.

- **To check your applications recursion limit, you can run the following code snippet:**
```
 import sys
 print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
```

- **How to modify the default recursion limit**

If for example, you want to increase or decrease the predefined recursion limit in your program, you can do that by calling the ```sys.setrecursionlimit()``` method as below:
```
 import sys
 sys.getrecursionlimit(500)
 print(sys.getrecursionlimit())
```
- **Recursion Use case: Finding the Factorial of a number**
One of the most many use cases of recursion is in finding the factorial of a number. If you’re familiar with loops in python, you would traditionally do it as below:

- **Finding a Factorial using a for loop**
```
 number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
 
 factorial = 1
 
 for i in range(1, number + 1):
	 factorial = factorial * i
 
 print("The Factorial of ", number, " is ", factorial)
```
- ```
   Enter a number:5
   The factorial of 5 is 120
  ``` 

- **Using a while loop, the syntax resembles:**
```
 number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
 
 factorial = 1
 i = 1
 
 while i <= number:
	 factorial = factorial * i
	 i = i + 1
 
 print("The factorial of ", number, " is ", factorial)
```
- ```
   Enter a number:6
   The factorial of 6 is 720
  ``` 
-  **However, implementing recursion, the syntax looks like**:  
```
 number = int(input('Enter a number: '))

 def factorial_recursion(number):
   if number == 1: #base case 
     return 1
   return number * factorial_recursion(number - 1) #recursive case

 print('The Factorial of',number , 'is', factorial_recursion(number))
```
we get the same output
```
  Enter a number:5
  The factorial of 5 is 120
```
**Advantages of recursion**

1. Recursion helps to make our code easier to write.

2. Recursion helps make code easier to read and understand. 
 
3. Another advantage of recursion is that it takes fewer lines of code to solve a problem using recursion.

**Disadvantages of recursion**

1.  Not all problems can be solved using recursion.

2.  If the base case in a recursive function is not defined, the code would run indefinitely.

3.  It is relatively more difficult to debug a recursive function since the function in question is calling itself in a loop and so it hard to understand exactly which call is causing the issue.

4.  Making calls to recursive functions is generally not memory efficient.
