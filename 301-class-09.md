# Refactoring

- **Refactoring**:- can extend the life of source code, preventing it from becoming legacy code. The refactoring process makes future enhancements to such code a more pleasant experience. Refactoring is also known as reengineering.

- **Refactoring** definitely helps you to improve the code quality. It makes variable names more clear, describes functions, or returns more meaningful error messages. All these small things make up a better product.

- But what exactly is JavaScript refactoring about? Refactoring includes many elements, such as:

1. Writing clear, understandable, and maintainable code.

2. Writing meaningful comments and error messages.

3. Sticking to standards like naming conventions and code structure.

4. Modularizing chunks of code and how to structure those modules.

### five tips for improving code quality.

 #### 1.Commenting:- 
you must spend time making sure your code is understandable. In my opinion, adding comments to your code always adds extra value. Although the code itself should be easy to read and understand, having extra explanations of a function helps the next person working with the code quickly grasp the purpose of a particular function.

- **How to Comment Meaningfully**:-  three   comment types:

   - **Top-Level Commenting**:- should give the reader an initial explanation of the purpose and responsibilities of a file. A two or three line comment is sufficient to give a fellow developer a clear indication of the purpose of the file.

   - **Class-Level Commenting**:- add a short description to each class they define.A class-level comment should include details about:

     - Goal and scope
     - Usage
     - Location in the bigger architectural picture.

   - **Function-Level Commenting**:- Function-level comments should, for example, describe how the function converts input to output or explain the business logic.

#### 2.JavaScript Refactoring According to Standards:
 every language has its own set of standards you can decide to follow. Let’s explore some commonly-used naming standards for JavaScript.

   - **Naming Arrays**:-at An array,If a developer reads code or looks at the interface of a function, they immediately know that a variable that ends in **s** is most likely an array.

   - ```const numbers = [1,2,3,4];```

   - **Naming Booleans**:- For Booleans,we want to stick to natural language.
   we want to know if a person is sick so we use **isSick**. **is** and **has** commonly used.

   Both is and has are commonly used prepositions to indicate the variable holds a Boolean.

   - **Looping Arrays**:-Let’s take a look at the below example, which takes a car out of the cars array
   - Ex: ```for (const car of cars){ };```

#### 3.Meaningful Variable Names:
 A name should be descriptive and tell a fellow developer what it holds.
 - Ex: ```const t + 10; //elapsed time in days``` 

 - ```const elapsedTime = 10;``` this name is much better but what is numbers represents.

 - ```const elapsedTimeInDays = 10;```This name is much better as it indicates the variable holds a number and explains what the number represents.

#### 4.Returning Errors
 While refactoring, it makes sense to read every error message carefully. Does the message describe the exact reason for the error?

 - Ex: **Ambiguous Message**:Assume we try to log in to an application, but our login attempt fails. The application returns **“You can’t log in to the application.”** This message is not descriptive enough. It can refer to many possible errors: **system down**, **wrong username**, or **no access to the application**.

 - Try to return a clear error message, like **“Password doesn’t match username.”**

 - **Avoid Technical Jargon**:avoid using technical jargon. Try to explain what went wrong in plain language. 

 - Ex: Let’s say the application lost connection to the server:

 - Good: **“Network connection is lost.”**

 - Bad: **“Error with code N-23 occurred. Operation could not be completed**

#### 5.Modularization
 When refactoring code, you should spend time analyzing the structure or hierarchy of the code. The structure of code can give us valuable information as well. 

 - Ex:a file full of **util** functions contains two functions: **add** and **subtract**. Both functions perform mathematical operations. We can easily group them into a Maths module which exposes both functions.
