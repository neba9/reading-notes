# how to computer works:-
- A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device.

# A binary code :-
- represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often "0" and "1" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction

# This circuit:-
- takes in two individual bits, each one, a one or a zero, and adds them together to calculate the sum. The sum can be zero plus zero equals zero, zero plus one equals one, or one plus one equals two. You need two wires coming out because it can take up to two binary digits to represent the sum.

# Central processing unit (CPU):- 
 -The microprocessor "brain" of the computer system is called the central processing unit. Everything that a computer does is overseen by the CPU. Memory - This is very fast storage used to hold data.

 - **Hardware** means the the components of a computer, Hardware powers and allows the PC to function. e.g. hard drive monitor, keyboard... **Soft ware** is the thing that makes the hardware useful. One good example of software is Windows.
