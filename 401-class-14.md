**matplotlib**: is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.

**IPython and the pylab mode**
*IPython* is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more.When we start it with the command line argument -pylab (--pylab since IPython version 0.12), it allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

*pyplot* provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

**Simple plot**: In this section, we want to draw the cosine and sine functions on the same plot.we'll enrich the figure step by step to make it nicer.

The first step is to get the data for the sine and cosine functions:
```
  import numpy as np

  X = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256, endpoint=True)
  C, S = np.cos(X), np.sin(X)
```

X is now a NumPy array with 256 values ranging from -π to +π (included). C is the cosine (256 values) and S is the sine (256 values).

To run the example, you can download each of the examples and run it using:
```
  $ py thon exercice_1.py
```
**Matplotlib**: comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties. You can control the defaults of almost every property in matplotlib:figure *size and dpi*, *line width*, *color and style*, *axes, axis* and *grid properties*, *text* and *font properties* and so on.

**Changing colors and line widths**: As a first step, we want to have the cosine in blue and the sine in red and a slightly thicker line for both of them. We'll also slightly alter the figure size to make it more horizontal.
```
  plt.figure(figsize=(10,6), dpi=80)
  plt.plot(X, C, color="blue", linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
  plt.plot(X, S, color="red",  linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
```
**Setting limits**:Current limits of the figure are a bit too tight and we want to make some space in order to clearly see all data points.
```
  plt.xlim(X.min()*1.1, X.max()*1.1)
  plt.ylim(C.min()*1.1, C.max()*1.1)
```

**Setting ticks**:Current ticks are not ideal because they do not show the interesting values (+/-π,+/-π/2) for sine and cosine. We'll change them such that they show only these values.
```
  plt.xticks( [-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi])
  plt.yticks([-1, 0, +1])
```
**Setting tick labels**: Ticks are now properly placed but their label is not very explicit. We could guess that 3.142 is π but it would be better to make it explicit. When we set tick values, we can also provide a corresponding label in the second argument list. Note that we'll use latex to allow for nice rendering of the label.

```
  plt.xticks([-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi],
        [r'$-\pi$', r'$-\pi/2$', r'$0$', r'$+\pi/2$', r'$+\pi$'])

  plt.yticks([-1, 0, +1],
        [r'$-1$', r'$0$', r'$+1$'])
```

**Moving spines**:Spines are the lines connecting the axis tick marks and noting the boundaries of the data area. They can be placed at arbitrary positions and until now, they were on the border of the axis. We'll change that since we want to have them in the middle. Since there are four of them (top/bottom/left/right), we'll discard the top and right by setting their color to none and we'll move the bottom and left ones to coordinate 0 in data space coordinates.
```
  ax = plt.gca()
  ax.spines['right'].set_color('none')
  ax.spines['top'].set_color('none')
  ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom')
  ax.spines['bottom'].set_position(('data',0))
  ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('left')
  ax.spines['left'].set_position(('data',0))
```

**Adding a legend**:Let's add a legend in the upper left corner. This only requires adding the keyword argument label (that will be used in the legend box) to the plot commands.
```
  plt.plot(X, C, color="blue", linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-", label="cosine")
  plt.plot(X, S, color="red",  linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-", label="sine")

  plt.legend(loc='upper left', frameon=False)
```

**Annotate some points**:et's annotate some interesting points using the annotate command. We choose the 2π/3 value and we want to annotate both the sine and the cosine. We'll first draw a marker on the curve as well as a straight dotted line. Then, we'll use the annotate command to display some text with an arrow.
```
  t = 2*np.pi/3
  plt.plot([t,t],[0,np.cos(t)], color ='blue', linewidth=1.5, linestyle="--")
  plt.scatter([t,],[np.cos(t),], 50, color ='blue')

  plt.annotate(r'$\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3})=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$',
              xy=(t, np.sin(t)), xycoords='data',
              xytext=(+10, +30), textcoords='offset points', fontsize=16,
              arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->", connectionstyle="arc3,rad=.2"))

  plt.plot([t,t],[0,np.sin(t)], color ='red', linewidth=1.5, linestyle="--")
  plt.scatter([t,],[np.sin(t),], 50, color ='red')

  plt.annotate(r'$\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3})=-\frac{1}{2}$',
              xy=(t, np.cos(t)), xycoords='data',
              xytext=(-90, -50), textcoords='offset points', fontsize=16,
              arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->", connectionstyle="arc3,rad=.2"))
```

**Devil is in the details**:The tick labels are now hardly visible because of the blue and red lines. We can make them bigger and we can also adjust their properties such that they'll be rendered on a semi-transparent white background. This will allow us to see both the data and the labels.
```
  for label in ax.get_xticklabels() + ax.get_yticklabels():
      label.set_fontsize(16)
      label.set_bbox(dict(facecolor='white', edgecolor='None', alpha=0.65 ))
```
```
  plt.savefig("../figures/exercice_10.png",dpi=72)
  plt.show()
```
