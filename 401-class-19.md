# Python Regular Expression Tutorial

**Regular Expressions**:- often shortened as *regex*, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not. 

In Python, *regular expressions* are supported by the re module. if we want to use we have to import ```re```
```
  import re
```

**Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters**:-are the simplest regular expressions. They match themselves exactly and do not have a special meaning in their regular expression syntax.
```
  Examples are 'A', 'a', 'X', '5'.
```
Ordinary characters can be used to perform simple exact matches:
```
  pattern = r"Cookie"
  sequence = "Cookie"
  if re.match(pattern, sequence):
      print("Match!")
  else: print("Not a match!")
```
```
  Match!
```
Most alphabets and characters will match themselves,

The ```match()``` function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns ```None```.

```r``` at the start of the pattern Cookie.
This is called a raw *string literal*.

```\``` is just a backslash when prefixed with an r rather than being interpreted as an escape sequence.

**Wild Card Characters: Special Characters**:-Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression.

```.``` - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
```
  re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
```
```
  'Cookie'
```

```^``` - A caret. Matches the start of the string.
This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence starts with certain characters.
```
  re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat cake!").group()
```
```
  'Eat'
```

```$``` - Matches the end of string.
This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence ends with certain characters.
```
  re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()
```
```
  'cake'
```

```[abc]``` - Matches a or b or c.
```[a-zA-Z0-9]``` - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).

  ```TIP:``` Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is ^, all the characters that are not in the set will be matched.

```
  re.search(r'[0-6]', 'Number: 5').group()
```
```
  '5'
```

```\``` - Backslash.
Perhaps, the most diverse metacharacter!!

- If the character following the backslash is a ```recognized escape character```, then the special meaning of the term is taken (Scenario 1)

- Else if the character following the ```\``` is not a recognized escape character, then the ```\``` is treated like any other character and passed through (Scenario 2).

- ```\```can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning (Scenario 3).

```
  ## (Scenario 1) This treats '\s' as an escape character, '\s' defines a space
  re.search(r'Not a\sregular character', 'Not a regular character').group()
```
```
  'Not a regular character'
```

```
  ## (Scenario 2) '\' is treated as an ordinary character, because '\r' is not a recognized escape character
  re.search(r'Just a \regular character', 'Just a \regular character').group()
```
```
  'Just a \regular character'
```

```
  ## (Scenario 3) '\s' is escaped using an extra `\` so its interpreted as a literal string '\s'
  re.search(r'Just a \\sregular character', 'Just a \sregular character').group()
```
```
  'Just a \\sregular character'
```
There is a predefined set of special sequences that begin with '\' and are also very helpful when performing search and match. Let's look at some of them up close...

```\w``` - Lowercase 'w'. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.
```\W``` - Uppercase 'W'. Matches any character not part of ```\w``` (lowercase w).

```
  print("Lowercase w:", re.search(r'Co\wk\we', 'Cookie').group())

  ## Matches any character except single letter, digit or underscore
  print("Uppercase W:", re.search(r'C\Wke', 'C@ke').group())

  ## Uppercase W won't match single letter, digit
  print("Uppercase W won't match, and return:", re.search(r'Co\Wk\We', 'Cookie'))
```
```
  Lowercase w: Cookie
  Uppercase W: C@ke
  Uppercase W won't match, and return: None
```

```\s``` - Lowercase 's'. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.
```\S``` - Uppercase 'S'. Matches any character not part of ```\s``` (lowercase s).

```
  print("Lowercase s:", re.search(r'Eat\scake', 'Eat cake').group())
  print("Uppercase S:", re.search(r'cook\Se', "Let's eat cookie").group())
```
```
  Lowercase s: Eat cake
  Uppercase S: cookie
```
```\d``` - Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.
```\D``` - Uppercase d. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.
```
  # Example for \d
  print("How many cookies do you want? ", re.search(r'\d+', '100 cookies').group())
```
```
  How many cookies do you want?  100
```
The + symbol used after the \d in the example above is used for repetition. 

```\t``` - Lowercase t. Matches tab.

```\n``` - Lowercase n. Matches newline.

```\r``` - Lowercase r. Matches return.

```\A``` - Uppercase a. Matches only at the start of the string. Works across multiple lines as well.

```\Z``` - Uppercase z. Matches only at the end of the string.

  ```TIP:``` ```^``` and ```\A``` are effectively the same, and so are ```$``` and ```\Z```. Except when dealing with MULTILINE mode.

```\b``` - Lowercase b. Matches only the beginning or end of the word.
```
  # Example for \t
  print("\\t (TAB) example: ", re.search(r'Eat\tcake', 'Eat    cake').group())

  # Example for \b
  print("\\b match gives: ",re.search(r'\b[A-E]ookie', 'Cookie').group())
```
```
  \t (TAB) example:  Eat    cake
  \b match gives:  Cookie
```

**Repetitions**:- the re module handles repetitions using the following special characters:

```+``` - Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position.

```
  re.search(r'Co+kie', 'Cooookie').group()
```
```
  'Cooookie'
```

```*``` - Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times starting from that position.
```
  # Checks for any occurrence of a or o or both in the given sequence
  re.search(r'Ca*o*kie', 'Cookie').group()
```
```
  'Cookie'
```

```?``` - Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time starting from that position.

```
  # Checks for exactly zero or one occurrence of a or o or both in the given sequence
  re.search(r'Colou?r', 'Color').group()
```
```
  'color'
```

```{x}``` - Repeat exactly x number of times.
```{x,}```- Repeat at least x times or more.
```{x, y}```- Repeat at least x times but no more than y times.

```
  re.search(r'\d{9,10}', '0987654321').group()
```
```
  '0987654321'
```

**Grouping in Regular Expressions**:- The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up parts of the matching text. Parts of a regular expression pattern bounded by parenthesis ```()``` are called groups. The parenthesis does not change what the expression matches, but rather forms groups within the matched sequence. You have been using the ```group()``` function.
The plain ```match.group()``` without any argument is still the whole matched text as usual. 

Imagine you were validating email addresses and wanted to check the user name and host. This is when you would want to create separate groups within your matched text.

```
  statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
  match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', statement)
  if statement:
    print("Email address:", match.group()) # The whole matched text
    print("Username:", match.group(1)) # The username (group 1)
    print("Host:", match.group(2)) # The host (group 2)
```
```
  Email address: support@datacamp.com
  Username: support
  Host: datacamp.com
```

**Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching**:-When a special character matches as much of the search sequence (string) as possible, it is said to be a "Greedy Match". It is the normal behavior of a regular expression, but sometimes this behavior is not desired:

```
  pattern = "cookie"
  sequence = "Cake and cookie"

  heading  = r'<h1>TITLE</h1>'
  re.match(r'<.*>', heading).group()
```
```
  '<h1>TITLE</h1>'
```
