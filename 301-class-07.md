# What Google Learned About Teams

- A group of us in Google’s People Operations (what we call HR) set out to answer this question using data and rigorous analysis: What makes a Google team effective?
- We were dead wrong. Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.

- We learned that there are five key dynamics that set successful teams apart from other teams at Google:

1. **Psychological safety**: Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?

2. **Dependability**: Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?

3. **Structure & clarity**: Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?

4. **Meaning of work**: Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?

5. **Impact of work**: Do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?

- If you answered **“yes”** to the five questions above, congrats! You’re probably on a high-performing team.

- This is a shortcut to help you figure out where to focus, how to get better, and a way to talk about this concept with your teammates in a structured way.

1. **Psycological safety**: Team memberes feel safe to take sisks and be vulnerable in front of each other.

2. **Dependability**:Team members get thinks done on time and meet Google's high bar for excellence.

3. **Structure & clarity**:Team members have clear roles,plans, and goals.

4. **Meaning of work**:Work is persinally important to team members.

5. **Impact of work**:Team members think their work matters and creates change.
