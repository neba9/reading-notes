# CSS Notes

## CSS
   - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

   ### css rules contains two partes: a **selector** and **declaration**


### Selectors:-
     - indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you
       separate the element names with commas.

### Declarations :-
     - indicate howthe elements referred to in the selector should be styled.Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value),and are separated by a colon.
      
      ```p {
          font-family:arial;
          } ```

### css properties affect how elementes are displayed.
- CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon. 

- **Properties**indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font,width, height and border.

- **Values** specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.

``` h1,h2,h2{font-family:arial;
            color:yellow;} ```
