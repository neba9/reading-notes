# How to use the Random Module in Python

- **When to use it?**:- We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

- **Random functions**:- The Random module contains some very useful functions.

#### Randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.
```
  import random
  print random.randint(0, 5)
```
- This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

**Random**:- If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.For example, a random number between 0 and 100:
```
  import random
  random.random() * 100
```
**Choice**:- Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
```
  random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] ).
```
**The choice function** can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.
```
  import random
  myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
  random.choice(myList)
```
**Shuffle**:- The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
Example:random.shuffle should work. Here's an example, where the objects are lists:
```
  from random import shuffle
  x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
  shuffle(x)

  # print(x)  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
  # of course your results will vary
```
**Randrange**:- Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
```
  random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
  import random
  for i in range(3):
      print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```
**Code Example**
```
  import random
  import itertools

  outcomes = { 'heads':0,
              'tails':0,
              }
  sides = outcomes.keys()

  for i in range(10000):
      outcomes[ random.choice(sides) ] += 1

  print 'Heads:', outcomes['heads']
  print 'Tails:', outcomes['tails']
```
There are only two outcomes allowed, so rather than use numbers and convert them, the words “heads” and “tails” are used with choice().

The results are tabulated in a dictionary using the outcome names as keys.
```
  $ python random_choice.py

  Heads: 4984
  Tails: 5016
```
#### What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

1. **Why use Risk Analysis?** :- In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.

- what could be the possible risks that you could encounter? Well here is a list:
  - Use of new hardware
  - Use of new technology
  - Use of new automation tool
  - The sequence of code
  - Availability of test resources for the application

- Now, you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable. I am enumerating them below:

  - The **time** that you allocated for **testing**
  - A **defect leakage** due to the complexity or size of the application
  - Urgency from the **clients** to deliver the project
  - Incomplete requirements

- In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:

  - Conduct **Risk Assessment** review meeting

  - Use **maximum resources** to work on high-risk areas

  - Create a **Risk Assessment database** for future use

  - Identify and notice the **risk magnitude indicators**: high, medium, low.

      **High**: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

      **Medium**: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

      **Low**: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

2. **Risk Identification**:- There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

    1. Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

    2. Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

    3. Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

    4. Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

After identifying the risks associated with your software, the next step is to assess the risks; i.e, Risk Assessment.

3. **Risk Assessment**
In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically. There are a few perspectives on risk assessment. Read on!
    1. Early forcast of unwanted aituatuon in your project
    2. Estimating potentinal loss of such situation
    3. Making decision to deal with such situation
    4. Avoid the fiture consequences

4. **The perspective of Risk Assessment**   
  There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment:

    - **Effect** – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

    - **Cause** – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

    - **Likelihood** – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

5. **How to perform Risk Analysis?**: There are three steps:
    - **Searching the risk**

    - **Analyzing the impact of each individual risk**

    - **Measures for the risk identified**
