# Django Using models:

**Django**:- web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc. 

**The definition of the model**:- is independent of the underlying database — you can choose one of several as part of your project settings.

#### Designing the LocalLibrary models:
We want to be able to sort information based on book title, author, written language, and category.

When designing your models it makes sense to have separate models for every "object" (a group of related information).In this case, the obvious objects are books, book instances, and authors.

Obvious candidates for models, in this case, include the book genre (e.g. Science Fiction, French Poetry, etc.) and language (English, French, Japanese).

Once we've decided on our models and field, we need to think about the relationships. Django allows you to define relationships that are one to one (OneToOneField), one to many (ForeignKey) and many to many (ManyToManyField).

#### Model definition:
Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata. The code fragment below shows a "typical" model, named MyModelName:
```
  from django.db import models

  class MyModelName(models.Model):
      """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

      # Fields
      my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
      ...

      # Metadata
      class Meta:
          ordering = ['-my_field_name']

      # Methods
      def get_absolute_url(self):
          """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
          return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

      def __str__(self):
          """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
          return self.my_field_name
```
##### Fields
A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value. Let's look at the example seen below:
```
  my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
```
- max_length=20 — States that the maximum length of a value in this field is 20 characters.
- help_text='Enter field documentation' — provides a text label to display to help users know what value to provide when this value is to be entered by a user via an HTML form.

The field name is used to refer to it in queries and templates. Fields also have a label specified as an argument (verbose_name), the default value of which is None, meaning replacing any underscores in the field name with a space (for example my_field_name would have a default label of my field name). Note that when the label is used as a form label through Django frame, the first letter of the label is capitalised (for example my_field_name would be My field name).
The order that fields are declared will affect their default order if a model is rendered in a form (e.g. in the Admin site), though this may be overridden.

##### Metadata
You can declare model-level metadata for your Model by declaring class Meta, as shown.
```
  class Meta:
      ordering = ['-my_field_name']
```
One of the most useful features of this metadata is to control the default ordering of records returned when you query the model type.You do this by specifying the match order in a list of field names to the ordering attribute, as shown above.The ordering will depend on the type of field (character fields are sorted alphabetically, while date fields are sorted in chronological order). 

So as an example, if we chose to sort books like this by default:
```
  ordering = ['title', '-pubdate']
```
the books would be sorted alphabetically by title, from A-Z, and then by publication date inside each title, from newest to oldest.

Another common attribute is verbose_name, a verbose name for the class in singular and plural form:
```
  verbose_name = 'BetterName'
```
##### Methods:-
Minimally, in every model you should define the standard Python class method __str__() to return a human-readable string for each object.This string is used to represent individual records in the administration site (and anywhere else you need to refer to a model instance). Often this will return a title or name field from the model.
```
  def __str__(self):
      return self.field_name
```
Another common method to include in Django models is get_absolute_url(), which returns a URL for displaying individual model records on the website (if you define this method then Django will automatically add a "View on Site" button to the model's record editing screens in the Admin site). A typical pattern for get_absolute_url() is shown below.
```
  def get_absolute_url(self):
      """Returns the url to access a particular instance of the model."""
      return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])
```

##### Model management
Once you've defined your model classes you can use them to create, update, or delete records, and to run queries to get all records or particular subsets of records. 

**Creating and modifying records**:- To create a record you can define an instance of the model and then call save().
```
  # Create a new record using the model's constructor.
  record = MyModelName(my_field_name="Instance #1")

  # Save the object into the database.
  record.save()
```
