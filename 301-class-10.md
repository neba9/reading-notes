# Call stack

- **A call stack**:- is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple **functions**.  what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

- An understanding of the **call stack** will give clarity to how **“function hierarchy and execution order”** works in the JavaScript engine.

- The **call stack** is primarily used for **function invocation (call)**. Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

- At the most basic level, **a call stack is a data structure** that uses the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

- **LIFO**: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

- **Temporarily store**: When a function is **invoked (called)**, the function, its parameters, and variables are **pushed** into the **call stack** to form a stack frame. This stack frame is a **memory location** in the **stack**. The memory is **cleared** when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

- **Manage function invocation (call)**: The **call stack** maintains a **record** of the position of each stack frame. It knows the **next function to be executed** (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous.

- Ex: ```function firstFunction(){```
  ```console.log('Hello from firstFunction');```
```}```

```function secondFunction(){```
  ```firstFunctin();```
  ```console.log('The end from secondFunction');```
```}```

```secondFunction();```

- **the output** 
- Hello from firstFunction
- The end from secondFunction

- **This is what happens when the code is run**:

1.  When **secondFunction()** gets executed, an empty stack frame is created.

2.  **secondFunction()** then calls **firstFunction()** which is pushed into the stack.

3. ** firstFunction()** returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.

4. **firstFunction()** is pop off the stack.

5. The execution order then move to **secondFunction()**.

6. **secondFunction()** returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.

7. **secondFunction()** is pop off the stack, clearing the memory.

- **What causes a stack overflow?**: A **stack overflow** occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

- Ex: ```function callMyself(){```
  ```callMyself();```
```}```
```callMyself();```

- The **callMyself()** will run until the browser throws a **“Maximum call size exceeded”**. And that is a stack overflow.

-  ### debugging:

- **debugging***: is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems .

#### Types of error messages

1. **Reference errors**:This is also a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs.

- Whatever you are using (var, let or const) the fix is as simple has declaring the variable before any declaration is made.

2. **Syntax errors**:The SyntaxError object represents an error when trying to interpret syntactically invalid code. It is thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters tokens or token order that does not conform to the syntax of the language when parsing code.

3. **Range errors**:Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.
- An array for instance cannot have a negative length, why would you mess with the array length? 

4. **Type errors**: Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.This is probably the most frequent error in JS,trying to access a property/method.
