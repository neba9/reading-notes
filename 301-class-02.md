- **jQuery**:- is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

- **SELECT ELEMENTS**:it is simpler to access elements using jquery's css-style selectors thann ot is using DOM queries.the selectors are also more pworfull and flexible.

- ex: function (creates jquery object )

- the jquery() function has one parametres:a css- style selector. ```$('li.hot')``` this selector finds all of the ```<li>```elements with a class of hot.


- **PERFORM TASKS**:- jquery's methods let you update the DOM tree, animate element into and out of view, and loop through a set of elements, all on one line of code.

- ```$('li.hot').addclass('complete');```
- the member oprator indicates that the method on the right should be used to update the elements in the jquery object on the left.
- Each method has parameter(s) that provide detailes about how to update the elements. theis parameter speciies a value to add to the class attribute. 

- **HANDLE EVENTS**:- jquery's includes methods that allow you to attach event listenres to selected elements without having to write any fallback code to support older browsers.

- The  **.html()** :-When this method is used to retrieve information from a jQuery selection, it retrieves only the HTML inside the first element in the matched set, along
with any of its descendants. and  **.text()** :-When this method is used to retrieve the text from a jQuery selection, it returns the content from every
element in the jQuery selection, along with the text
from any descendants.

- bothe methods retrieve and update the content of elements.

- **UPDATING ELEMENTS**:-Here are four methods that update the content of all elements in a jQuery selection .

1. **.html()** :This method gives every element
in the matched set the same new content. The new content may include HTML. 

2. **.text()** :This method gives every element in the matched set the same new text content. Any markup would be shown as text.

3. **.replaceWith()** : This method replaces every
element in a matched set with new content. It also returns the replaced elements.

4. **.remove()** : This method removes all of the elements in the matched set.

- ex: ```$(' l i .hot' ) .html( function()```
```return '<em>' + $(this) .text() + '</ em> ';```
```} );```
- return indicates that content should be returned by the function.
- <em> tags are placed around the text content of the list item.
- this refers to the current list item. $ (this) places that element in a
new jQuery object so that you can use jQuery methods on it.

- **INSERTING ELEMENTS**:- Inserting new elements involves two steps:

1. CREATING NEW ELEMENTS IN A JQUERY OBJECT:
- The fo llowing statement creates a variable called $newFragment and stores a jQuery object in it. The jQuery object is set to contain an empty.
```<l i>element:var $newFragment = $('<li>'};```

2. ADDING THE NEW ELEMENTS TO THE PAGE:Once you have a variable holding th~ new content, you can use the following methods to add the content to the DOM tree:

- .before(), .after(), .prepend() and .append()
- There are also . prependTo() and . appendTo() methods. They work the other way around from .prepend () and .append () .

- **EVENT METHODS**:- The .on() method is used to handle all events.

- ex: ```$('li') .on('click', function() { + $(this)``` ```.addClass( ' complete');});```

- The jQuery selection contains all of the <1i>elements.
- The .on() method is used to handle events. It needs two parameters:
- The first parameter is the event you want to respond to. Here it is the c1ick event.
- The second parameter is the code you want to run when that event occurs on any element in the matched set. This could be a named.
function or an anonymous function. Above, it is an anonymous function that adds a value of complete to the cl ass attribute .

- Every event handling function receives an event object.
It has methods and properties related to the event that occurred.

- ex: ```$( ' li ') .on( ' cl ick' function(e)```
```eventType = e.type ;```
```});```
- Give the event object a parameter name (like first e) .
- Use that name in the function to reference the event object (like secound e ).
- Access the properties and methods of the object using the familiar dot notation (the member operator  'type').
