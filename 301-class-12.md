# EJS Partials

- **EJS** combines data and a template to produce HTML. One of the most important features in EJS is its use of **partials**. **Partials** allow you to define something once, and then apply it to any page in your application. 

- **Partials** come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in.

-  **EJS** partials, which are used to help us to avoid repetition of the same code on several web pages.

- For example, you may want the same header for several web pages.***EJS partials** work like EJS layouts too in creating a single fix content on a web page.

- **EJS partials** apply in cases like creating objects like header, footer, div.

- Ex: save as **app.js**
```
 var express = require('express');
 var ejs = require('ejs');
 var app = express();

 app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
 app.get("/", function(req, res){
   res.render("home");
 });
 app.get("/about", function(req, res){
   res.render("about");
 });
 app.listen(3000, function(){
   console.log("server is listening!!");
 });
```
- the code above, we have included the express-ejs-layouts module and have also created a new route.

- **Now, let's create our ejs files:**

- We created 2 routes and have rendered both routes to an **ejs file**. Now let's create our ejs files.

-  save as next code at **home.ejs**
```
  <%include('partials/partial')%>
  <h4>Home page</h4>
```
- The **home.ejs** file has a link to the **partial.ejs** file which serves as the partial.   

-  type the following code, save as **about.ejs**

```<h3>About US</h3>```

- You can clearly see that the **about.ejs** file has no link to the partial so it won't display the partial.

- Take a look at the different **ejs** tag used here.

- The logic here is, the server which is the **app.js** file is linked to the **home.ejs** and **about.ejs** files which the home.ejs file is linked to the partial with file name **partial.ejs**.

```<%- include('partioals/partial')%>```

- The path indicates that the partial is located in the **partials folder**. **Partials folder** is found in the **views folder** which is the default template engine location for express.

- The folder name **views** is not a random word I selected but it's the reserved folder name where express checks for template engine by default.

- Finally, initiate the **app.js** file with node **app.js** in a terminal and view the port in a browser.

- ```localhost:3000 and localhost:3000/about```

- OutPut

- OutPut under localhost:3000
```
 Hello!!, I'm a partial
  Home Page
```  

- OutPut under localhost:3000/about
```
  About US
```
- The about page doesn't display the partial because it has no link to it.
