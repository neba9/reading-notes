# JavaScript Templating Language and Engine 

### Mustache.js with Node and Express

- **Javascript Templating**:-Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

- The **template engine** then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

- **Mustache**:- is a simple web template system. It is available for many programming languages including JavaScript and Java.

- **Mustache**:- is a rich JavaScript templating library that is easy to use and easy to extend. It has no dependencies on any JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, but will work nicely with third party frameworks

- **mustache.js**:- is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.

- Ex: ```Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });```
- // returns: Hello, Sherlynn

- In the above, we see two braces around {{ name }}. This is Mustache syntax to show that it is a placeholder. When Mustache compiles this, it will look for the ‘name’ property in the object we pass in, and replace {{ name }} with the actual value, e,g, “Sherlynn”.

####  CSS flexbox layout

- **Flexbox**:- is a layout model that allows elements to **align and distribute space within a container**. Using flexible widths and heights, elements can be aligned to fill a space or distribute space between elements, which makes it a great tool to use for responsive design systems.

- The Flexbox Layout officially called **CSS Flexible Box** Layout Module is new layout module in CSS3 **made to improve the items align, directions and order in the container even when they are with dynamic or even unknown size**.

- A Flexible Layout must have a parent element with the display property set to flex.

- Direct child elements(s) of the flexible container automatically becomes flexible items.

- Ex:  ```<div class="flex-container">```
  ```<div>1</div>```
  ```<div>2</div>```
  ```<div>3</div>```
```</div>```

- ```<style>```
```.flex-container {```
  ```display: flex;```
  ```background-color: DodgerBlue;```
```}```

```.flex-container > div {```
  ```background-color: #f1f1f1;```
  ```margin: 10px;```
  ``padding: 20px;``
  ```font-size: 30px;```
```}```
```</style>```
