# Sending Form Data

- The **method attribute** specifies how to send form-data (the form-data is sent to the page specified in the action attribute). The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post"). Notes on GET: Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs.

- **On the client side: defining how to send the data**:- The **<form>** element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are **action** and **method**.

- **The action attribute**: The **action** attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a **valid relative** or **absolute URL**.If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the **URL** of the page containing the form — the current page.

- Ex: In this example, the data is sent to an **absolute URL** — https://example.com:
```
 <form action="http://example.com">
```

- Here, we use a **relative URL** — the data is sent to a different URL on the same origin:
```
 <form action="/somewhere_else">
```

- When specified with no attributes, as below, the <form> data is sent to the same page that the form is present on:
```
 <form>
```

- The **names** and **values** of the non-file form controls are sent to the server as **name=value** pairs joined with ampersands. The **action** value should be a file on the **server** that can handle the **incoming data**, including ensuring server-side validation. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load (or a refresh of the existing page, if the action points to the same page).

- **How the data is sent depends on the method attribute**.

#### The method attribute

- The **method** attribute defines how data is sent. The **HTTP protocol** provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the **GET method** and the **POST method**.

- the **browser** sends a request to a URL. An HTTP request consists of two parts: 

1.  A **header** that contains a set of **global metadata** about the browser's capabilities.

2.  A **body** that can contain **information** necessary for the server to process the specific request.

- The **GET method** is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty.if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.

-  If the form uses **GET**, the form data is **encoded** in the **URI** as a **query string**.

- get method:	Default. Appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs: URL?name=value&name=value.

- Consider the following form:
```
  <form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
  </form>
```
- Since the GET method has been used, you'll see the URL www.foo.com/?say=Hi&to=Mom

- The data is appended to the **URL** as a series of **name/value pairs**. After the URL web address has ended, we include a question mark **(?)** followed by the **name/value pairs**, each one separated by an ampersand **(&)**. In this case we are passing **two** pieces of data to the server:
1. **say**, which has a value of **Hi**
2. **to**, which has a value of **Mom**

- The HTTP request looks like this:
```
 GET /?say=Hi&to=Mom HTTP/2.0
 Host: foo.com
 
```
#### The POST method

- The **POST method** is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

-  If the form uses **POST**, the form data is placed in the **request body**. For **POSTed data**, the enctype attribute specifies the format of the **request body**: Form data is **encoded** as **name/value pairs**, similar to a URI query string.

- post method: Sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction.

- this is the same form we looked at in the **GET section above**, but with the method attribute set to **POST**.

- When the form is submitted using the **POST method**, you get no data appended to the **URL**, and the **HTTP request** looks like so, with the data included in the **request body instead**:
```
  POST / HTTP/2.0
  Host: foo.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Content-Length: 13

  say=Hi&to=Mom
```
- The **Content-Length header** indicates the **size of the body**, and the **Content-Type header** indicates the type of **resource sent to the server**.
